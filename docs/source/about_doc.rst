Project Documentation
=====================
The documentation of this project is generated with three tools: 
`Doxygen <https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html>`_, 
`Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html>`_, and
`breathe <https://breathe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. 
The main motivations behind using sphinx for generating docs for a 
c++ project, as well as implementation, are described in this 
blog post:
